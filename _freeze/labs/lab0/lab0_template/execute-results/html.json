In this (not graded) assignment, you'll practice the fundamental dplyr operations I overviewed in class using car sales data. This lab will help you get comfortable with:\n\n- Basic data exploration\n- Column selection and manipulation  \n- Creating new variables\n- Filtering data\n- Grouping and summarizing\n\n**Instructions:** Copy this template into your portfolio repository under a `lab_0/` folder, then complete each section with your code and answers. You will write the code under the comment section in each chunk.\nBe sure to also copy the data folder into your `lab_0` folder.\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse library\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n",
